title: LIFX Notifier
summary: |-
    Sends signals to your LIFX bulb during builds.
description: |-
    Add this step to your workflow when color change is required.

    This step can be used at the start (notify build start) and at the end (notify success/failure) of your workflow.
    If there's no need to notify about workflow start than adding step to the end of the workflow will be enough.
